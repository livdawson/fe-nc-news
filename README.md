# Northcoders News Board
 
Check out the live deployed web interface [here](https://nc-news-board.netlify.app).

## Overview

The Northcoders News Board is a social news aggregation, web content rating and discussion website. Users can explore an array of user-curated articles divided into different topics. It offers a user-friendly space to read, sort, vote and comment on articles.

## Back-End Repository 

The Northcoders News Board relies on a custom API service that I developed to handle data retrieval and management. The repository for this API can be accessed [here](https://github.com/livdawson/nc-news/).
